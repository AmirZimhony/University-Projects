# University-Projects
The assignments in this repository were given in the course "Systems Programming".
They make use of C++, Java, Python and SQL. Each task had a different theme to it:

-Assignment 1:  A C++ memory managed ordering system. We simulated the workflow of a restaurant, including OOP with classes for customers,
tables, dishes, etc. We practiced handling memory, avoiding memory leaks and implementing unique C++ properties such as "Rule of 5". 

-Assignment 2: Designing and developing a Java multithreaded Micro-Service framework. We simulated the workflow of an online bookstore, 
including threads that simulated the delivery of books, checking availability of a book, etc. In addition we practiced use of
Java Generics, Concurrency, and Synchronization.

-Assignment 3: Implementation of a concurrent Java based server that supports both Reactor and Thread Per Client (TPC) models with
a C++ client side. Simulating a social network including options of sending direct messages, posting messages, etc.

-Assignment 4: Creating and managing a database with Python and SQL (specifically sqlite). We implemented a simulator for assigning
classrooms to courses. A script was for creating the database (the database consisted of courses, students and classrooms), while another
script was in charge of orchestrating the schedule of the courses.
